# Full Stack Trivia API Project
This project is a game where users can test their knowledge answering trivia questions. The task for the project was to create an API and test suite for implementing the following functionality:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

## Getting Started

#### Installing Dependencies

Developers using this project should already have Python3, pip, node, and npm installed.

##### Frontend Dependencies
This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the `package.json` file located in the `/frontend`  directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash, cmd
npm install
```

##### Backend Dependencies
Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash, cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Frontend in Dev Mode
The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use `npm start`. You can change the script in the `package.json` file.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

```bash, cmd
npm start
```

## Running the Server
From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

## Testing
To run the tests, run

```bash, cmd
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```
Omit the dropdb command the first time you run tests.

## API Reference

### Getting Started

- Base URL: Currently this application is only hosted locally. The backend is hosted at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
- Authentication: This version does not require authentication or API keys.

### Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON in the following format:

```
{
   "success": False,
   "error": 404,
   "message": "resource not found"
}
```
The API will return three types of errors:

- 400 – bad request
- 404 – resource not found
- 405 - method not allowed
- 422 – unprocessable
- 500 - server error(rare)
